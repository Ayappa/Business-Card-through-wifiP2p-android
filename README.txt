Business Card app

We are creating two important functionalities using Barcode scanner.

1. Through QR code scan, we are sharing digital business cards which will have Name, phone number and other important details to connect and socialize.

2. Through QR code scan, we are sending money to other person

To facilitate this money exchange, we will be using BrainTree api for getting a dummy debit/credit card and show the transaction details.

- The app will directly store the data of the scanned user once the user confirms in the "Contacts" of the user.
-The app will have a digital wallet,that can be used to transfer money to other person.
-The money in the wallet can be added by using the dummy cards menntioned above.
-The app will handle multiple cards of a user and will allow them to save cards, add new cards and delete existing cards.
